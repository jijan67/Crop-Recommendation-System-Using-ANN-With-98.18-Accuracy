# Crop-Recommendation-System-Using-ANN-With-98.18-Accuracy
This research proposes an ANN-based crop recommendation system using soil and environmental data. Achieving 98.18% accuracy, it predicts suitable crops by training on a labeled dataset, applying scaling, label encoding, and evaluating performance with metrics like confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curves.
